                <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Computer programming is how engineers tell a computer,
                  application, or software program what to do. At the most basic
                  level, programming is the process of writing a set of
                  instructions.

                  Explain How Programming Works?
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Once the code is written, the code is then compiled or
                  interpreted, a process that converts source code into machine
                  code, which is the only programming language a computer can
                  understand. The computer then executes the code to perform the
                  desired task.

                  How Does a Syntax Error Occur?
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Syntax errors can occur when you misspell a statement, or
                  youâ€™re missing a punctuation mark. Another possibility is
                  using a variable before it has been declared. Missing brackets
                  (i.e. opening a bracket but not closing it) is another common
                  cause.

                  How Does a Logical Error Occur?
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Various programming mistakes can cause logic errors. Examples
                  include: assigning a value to the wrong variable, incorrectly
                  using logical operators or Boolean operators, using incorrect
                  program design, or multiplying two numbers instead of adding
                  them together.
